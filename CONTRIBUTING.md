## Issues vs. PRs

We use typical GitHub processes for making changes.  If you are making:
-  a specific fix or improvement: please open a GitHub Pull Request with the change.
-  a larger change to propose or new idea, add new data fields, or the like: please open a GitHub Issue to **start** a discussion before doing more work.
-  new project directions: we welcome new contributors with ideas for new projects; please start a Discussion or use an Issue to suggest some new project to work on.
