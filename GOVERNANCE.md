# Punderthings Projects Start As BDUC

This project's governance is currently defined as **BDUC**: Benevolent Dictator _Until Community_.

Shane Curcuru is currently the _Benevolent Dictator_; however the goal is to attract a self-governing open source community that can determine direction and build this project further than any one individual can.

Currently Shane determines project direction and standards, and makes final decisions on PRs.  Contributors with similar-enough goals who show a sustained interest may be invited as project maintainers.

Once I've found at least three other project maintainers for a project, we will decide on the project's governance model by consensus among all project maintainers.  Models could include an ASF-style Project Management Committee, something like [MVG: Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG/), or whatever other decision-making guidelines the maintainer community chooses.

Invariants will include using permissive licenses wherever practical, and planning to maintain the project (or mark it as a read-only archive) for the long term.
