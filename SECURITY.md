# Security Policy

As responsible open source project maintainers, we treat vulnerabilities and issues around privacy violations seriously.  We're also all volunteers, so we ask for your patience and responsible disclosures.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities or Privacy Issues

Vulnerabilities should be reported privately only to shane@punderthings.com, the organization owner.  Please ensure to clearly explain the issue, along with steps to reproduce and the reason(s) why this should be treated as a vulnerability.

## Coordinated Disclosure: 90 days

As an all-volunteer project, we will acknowledge any valid security vulnerabilities as soon as possible.  We also ask that you give us up to 90 days before making any public disclosures.

## Resources

A great place to learn about responsible security processes is the [OWASP Vulnerability Disclosure Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet.html).
