# Punderthings Productions Support

As an all-volunteer open source organization, there is no formal support provided.  If you have questions, bugs, or ideas, please use normal GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.  Please **do not use email**, unless you have a prior relationship with a specific developer.

Individual project members may offer paid support options independently, as long as they respect any existing Punderthings-related trademarks or service marks.
